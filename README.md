# Supply Chain Analysis - Capstone Project

The supply chain dataset comprises 24 columns and 100+ rows, containing information on various aspects of 
the supply chain, including product details, pricing, availability, sales, manufacturing, shipping, and costs. It is 
designed for analyzing revenue generation, manufacturing expenses, and transportation costs to optimize supply chain 
operations.

# Problem Statement

The supply chain dataset presents a comprehensive set of information related to product sales, 
manufacturing, and logistics. The challenge is to extract meaningful insights and actionable recommendations from the data to 
optimize supply chain operations and improve profitability.

Mysql Analysis:-
----------------

I used MySQL to analyze supply chain data and answer specific questions.

üìä Total Revenue by Product Type:
Calculate the total revenue generated by each product type. This can help identify the most profitable products.

üöö Shipping Costs by Carrier:
Calculate the average shipping costs for each shipping carrier to evaluate which carrier is the most cost-effective.

‚è≥ Lead Times by Supplier:
Calculate average lead times for each supplier to assess their reliability in delivering products on time.

üåç Total Products Sold by Location:
Determine the total number of products sold in each location to understand regional demand.

üîç Defect Rates by Inspection Results:
Calculate defect rates for different inspection results to assess product quality.

üí∞ Ranking Products by Profitability:
Write a query to rank products based on profitability, where profitability is calculated as (revenue generated - manufacturing costs - shipping costs).

üì¶ Supplier Performance Analysis:
Calculate the average lead time for each supplier and identify suppliers with lead times higher than the overall average.

üèÜ Top 5 Shipping Carriers by Cost Efficiency:
Determine the top 5 shipping carriers with the lowest average shipping costs per product shipped.

Excel Analysis Summary for Supply Chain Capstone Project

Create an Excel dashboard for your supply chain capstone project and visualize key insights from your supply chain dataset.

üìä Visualizing Key Insights

From the overall analysis, I have discovered some key insights:

üí∞ Skincare products are the most profitable, generating significant revenue. Haircare products come next in popularity, followed by cosmetics.

üöö Carrier C has the highest shipping costs on average, with carrier A as the second-costliest option. Carrier B, on the other hand, is the most affordable choice.

üõ≥Ô∏è Among the four transportation modes (air, rail, road, and sea), air transportation is associated with higher shipping costs, while sea transportation offers a more economical solution.

üìà The top locations for product sales are Kolkata and Delhi, closely followed by Mumbai and Chennai, each with a substantial number of products sold. In contrast, Bangalore reports the lowest number of products sold.

‚ùå Among the three types of products, haircare exhibits the highest defect rate at 37%, followed by skincare and cosmetics.

üíº The manufacturing cost of skincare products is higher than that of haircare and cosmetics.

This Excel dashboard provides a concise overview of the supply chain dataset, making it easier to understand and make data-driven decisions.

In Powe Bi, build charts, graphs, and KPIs to visualize the data and understand it more interactively, along with 
that, build some slicers to make it more user-friendly to customize the charts and graphs.

Build some cards to understand some key performance indicators, including:

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

1Ô∏è‚É£ Total Revenue: 577,000

2Ô∏è‚É£ Average Product Price: 49.46

3Ô∏è‚É£ Total Products Sold: 46,000

4Ô∏è‚É£ Manufacturing Cost: 47.27

5Ô∏è‚É£ Total Available Products: 4,840

6Ô∏è‚É£ Total Stock Value: 4,777

### Charts and Graphs:

1. Average Defect Rate, Manufacturing Lead Time, and Manufacturing Cost by Product

2. Customer Demographics vs. Number of Products Sold by Product Type

3. Total Revenue Generated by Product Type and Total Products Sold by Product Type

4. Average Manufacturing Cost vs. Average Price by Product Type

5. Transportation Modes vs. Routes with Average Cost

6. Defect Rate vs. Inspection Rate by Product Type

7. Transportation Modes and Shipping Carriers with Average Shipping Time

### Interactive Slicers:

Product Type

Transportation Mode

Shipping Carrier

Routes

Suppliers' Name
## Insights
1. The highest number of products sold among the three product categories is skincare, which accounts for 45% of the business. Haircare follows at 29%, and cosmetics contribute 25% to the revenue.

2. Analyzing customer demographics versus the number of products sold by product type reveals that the female group purchases higher-quality skincare and cosmetic products, while the male group opts for products of roughly equal quality in terms of haircare and cosmetics. 

An unknown group category purchases a higher quantity of all three product types. Skincare products are the most popular among all four product categories, indicating a high demand.

3. Analyzing product availability and stock levels shows that the company maintains an equal quantity of inventory for haircare and skincare products, with slightly less stock for cosmetics.
Skincare products exhibit higher availability and lower stock levels, enabling quick manufacturing and shipment. 

In contrast, cosmetics and haircare have higher stock levels and lower availability, meaning the company faces challenges in promptly shipping these products due to longer manufacturing times.

4. Skincare products have higher order quantities and longer lead times, often associated with higher production volumes. 


Higher production volumes necessitate longer lead times to ensure adequate time for manufacturing products to meet customer demand.

 Haircare products also exhibit longer lead times and higher production volumes, possibly due to the need for more specialized ingredients or manufacturing processes.

5. All product categories show a higher defect rate.

6. An analysis of revenue generated by shipping carriers indicates that shipping carrier B is costlier but generates higher revenue.

7. According to the graph, the fastest and most efficient shipping option is Carrier B, and the most efficient transportation mode is road in all four transportation modes.
